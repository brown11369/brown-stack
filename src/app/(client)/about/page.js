                <p className="sm:basis-1/2">Since beginning my journey as a freelance developer nearly 2+ years ago, Iâ€™ve done remote work, and collaborated with talented people to create web products for both business and consumer use. I create successful responsive websites that are fast, easy to use, and built with best practices. The main area of my expertise is front-end development, HTML, CSS, JS, building small and medium web apps, features, animations, and coding interactive layouts. I also have full-stack developer experience with popular open-source CMS and other technologies like (WordPress, React MongoDB, Express, Node).
