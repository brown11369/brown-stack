                        <p className="about">Since beginning my journey as a freelance developer nearly 2+ years ago, Iâ€™ve
                            done
                            remote work, and collaborated with talented people to
                            create
                            web products for both business and consumer use.
                            I create successful responsive websites that are fast, easy to use, and built with best
                            practices.
                            The main area of my expertise is front-end development, HTML, CSS, JS, building small and
                            medium web
                            apps, features, animations, and coding interactive layouts.
                            I also have full-stack developer experience with popular open-source CMS and other technologies like (WordPress, React MongoDB, Express, Node).
